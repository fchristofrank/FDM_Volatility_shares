I can hardly believe that three years have already passed. Time has flown by, and as I look back, I feel a deep sense of gratitude to God for blessing me with such an incredible team. You all are not just extremely talented and challenging, but you’ve also made this journey so much fun. Working with you has felt like being back in college, thanks to the warm environment and the constant guidance that made each day enjoyable and enriching.

The fun we had, the lunchtime gossips, the inside jokes—these are the memories I’ll carry with me long after our time together. I will genuinely miss the camaraderie and the unique bond we’ve shared in the office. But before I say goodbye, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you. Coming from a background in mechanical sciences, I had so much to learn in this new field, and you all made that learning process not only possible but enjoyable.

First and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Sree, my manager. Sree, you’ve been more than just a manager—you’ve been a mentor, a guide, and someone I could always count on. The opportunities and encouragement you’ve given me have been invaluable, and I couldn’t have asked for a better leader to steer me through these years.

I’d also like to extend my sincere thanks to our seniors, Dinesh ji and Sekar ji. Your wisdom and sound advice have been like a guiding light on my tech journey. You’ve helped me navigate through challenges and have always been there to offer support when I needed it most.

To my wonderful mentors and leads, Chinmaya and Supraja—I owe so much to your patience and understanding. Even when I struggled at the beginning, you never lost faith in me. Your guidance and belief in my potential gave me the confidence to push forward, and for that, I am eternally grateful.

Swetha and Yoga, I can’t thank you enough for all the help you’ve given me with my stories and for helping me improve my contributions. You two exemplify what it means to be true team players, and I feel incredibly blessed to have had the chance to work alongside you.

Solomon and Naveena, you have been such wonderful friends and colleagues throughout this journey. I’ve learned so much from both of you, not just professionally but personally as well. Your attention to detail and your curiosity to learn and contribute more have been a constant source of inspiration for me. I truly believe that I still have so much to learn from you both, and I’m excited about what the future holds.

To my dear friends KAAAS and Kriti—words can’t express how much your support and friendship have meant to me. You’ve been the best hackathon buddies I could ever ask for, and I’ve learned so much from you over the years. You’ve become as close as brothers to me, and I cherish the bond we’ve built. I hope we get the chance to work together again soon and create even more memories.

Ballu and Sakshi, you’ve always kept me grounded with your incredible passion for learning and your dedication to constantly improving. Watching you both strive to learn new things and update your skills has been truly inspiring. I have no doubt that you both have bright futures ahead, and I’m excited to see all the amazing things you’ll accomplish.

Finally, Kashish, Krishna, and Sanjana—I am truly in awe of your hard work and work ethic. Even at this stage, you continue to inspire me with your dedication and passion. I have no doubt that you’re all destined for great heights, and I’m so proud of everything you’ve achieved so far.

Thank you once again to each and every one of you. I hope we can stay in touch, and I wish nothing but the best for all of you. It’s been an honor and a privilege to work with such an amazing team.

God bless!
