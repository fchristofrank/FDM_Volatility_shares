Subject: A Heartfelt Farewell to an Amazing Team ðŸŒŸ

Dear Team,

As I prepare to move on to the next chapter of my career, I want to take a moment to thank each of you for the incredible support and guidance youâ€™ve given me during my time here.

Sree,
Youâ€™ve been an outstanding manager, always supportive and encouraging. Your leadership has been invaluable to me, and Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunities youâ€™ve provided. I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better mentor and guide.

Dinesh ji and Sekar ji,
Your wisdom and advice have been instrumental in my growth. Iâ€™ve learned so much from both of you, and I deeply appreciate the time and effort youâ€™ve invested in helping me succeed.

Chinmaya and Supraja,
Thank you for your patience and kindness. Youâ€™ve been incredibly supportive mentors, and your guidance has helped me develop both professionally and personally. Iâ€™m so grateful for the opportunities youâ€™ve given me to learn and grow.

Swetha and Yoga,
Your strong teamwork and unwavering support have been a huge part of my success here. Iâ€™ve always felt that I could rely on you, and Iâ€™m thankful for all the help youâ€™ve provided in making our projects a success.

KAAAS and Kriti,
Working with both of you has been one of the highlights of my time here. From tackling tough challenges in our hackathons to brainstorming solutions late into the night, youâ€™ve both shown incredible creativity and problem-solving skills. KAAAS, your ability to break down complex problems into manageable tasks has been a game-changer in many of our projects. Kriti, your attention to detail and relentless drive to get things right has pushed our work to a higher standard. Together, youâ€™ve made every project feel like an exciting adventure, and Iâ€™ve learned so much from our time working side by side. Iâ€™ll miss our collaboration and the energy you both bring to the table.

Ballu and Sakshi,
Your passion for learning and constant drive to improve have been truly inspiring. I admire your dedication and have been motivated by your example to push myself further. Thank you for keeping me grounded and focused.

Krishna and Sanjana,
Your hard work and dedication are remarkable. Iâ€™m confident that both of you will continue to achieve great things, and Iâ€™ve been impressed by your commitment to excellence.

Thank you all for being such an incredible part of my journey. Iâ€™ll always cherish the memories and lessons Iâ€™ve gained from working with each of you. Letâ€™s stay in touch, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.

Warm regards,
Christo Frank



Dear Team,

Three years have flown, like the blink of an eye,
It feels like college days, and I can't denyâ€”
This place, this team, has kept me young,
With laughter and learning, and songs unsung.
I'll miss the fun, the chats over lunch,
The gossip, the jokes, and our little hunch.
But more than that, I want to say,
Thank you for guiding me along the way.
To Sree, a manager like no other,
Youâ€™ve been a mentor, a guide, and almost a brother.
Dinesh ji and Sekar ji, with wisdom so bright,
Your advice has been my guiding light.
Chinmaya and Supraja, patient and kind,
You nurtured my growth, expanding my mind.
Swetha and Yoga, with teamwork so strong,
Youâ€™ve helped me thrive, where I belong.
KAAAS and Kriti, my partners in code,
With you, every challenge felt like a shared load.
Ballu and Sakshi, with passion so clear,
Youâ€™ve inspired me more than you could hear.
Krishna and Sanjana, hard workers through and through,
Iâ€™ve no doubt greatness awaits both of you.
So hereâ€™s my farewell, but not a goodbye,
For the memories weâ€™ve made will never die.
I hope we stay connected, in touch, and in cheer,
Wishing you all the best in the coming year.

With heartfelt thanks,
Christo Frank
